# Brain-tumor-Detection
Brain Tumor Detection involves analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) images of the brain to detect whether a tumor is present or not. We can train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI images into categories like:  
  
  Tumor Present  
  No Tumor

  Some datasets even classify tumor types (e.g., meningioma, glioma, pituitary tumor).
